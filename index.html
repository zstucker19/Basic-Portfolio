			<p id="p1">Well my name is Zack, and I'm just starting out in web design.  There's still a lot I need to learn right now, but hopefully everything will go smoothly.  I'll keep working on my HTML and CSS abilities until the creation of a website like this becomes second nature.
		<br>
			Even though I'm new, I've found these first few classes very helpful, and I am really looking forward to testing myself against more challenging programming languages throughout the course.  That's all the space I have for now, so I'll just stop writing here!</p>
